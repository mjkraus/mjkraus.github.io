#SIMON

This is a modern take on the classic game Simon. 

##How to Play

To begin the game, click the 'Start' button. 

The board will light up one of four color buttons. 

The player must mimick the pattern of the buttons, by clicking the correct color buttons in order.  

As each round increases, the button pattern gets more complex. 

The scoreboard, on the right side, keeps track of how many rounds the player has successfully completed. 

If the player cannot replicate the pattern, the game is over. 

A 'Restart' button will appear. Click on it to reset the game. 

Click 'Start' to play again!
